| Ports and terminals: | McMurdo, Palmer, and offshore anchorages in Antarctica |
| Ports and terminals: | note: few ports or harbors exist on southern side of Southern Ocean; ice conditions limit use of most to short periods in midsummer; even then some cannot be entered without icebreaker escort; most Antarctic ports are operated by government research stations and, except in an emergency, are not open to commercial or private vessels (2007) |
| Transportation - note: | Drake Passage offers alternative to transit through the Panama Canal |
